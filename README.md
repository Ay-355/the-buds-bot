# The Buds Bot

**Discord Bot made to help with the Buds Alliance**


---
The Buds Bot was made for the **Buds Alliance** to help with managing the server and clans. One of the main things we wanted was an auto role changer. Basically when a person joins or leaves a clan, it will update their clan roles depending over what clan they are in. Over time I will update the repo when new changes are made. I do not have an invite link because the way this bot is designed is that everything was made specifically for our clans. Please also look at the license.
